r"""
Abstract base class for flux balance analysis optimization engines.
In this case, the usage is intended that the solver will be initialized with
a base metabolic model and then solve a problem with some delta of changes.

This can be useful for linear program solvers with limited interfaces for updating
an existing problem (e.g. adding an extra term to a constraint).
